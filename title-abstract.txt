Title:
Longitudinal Integrative Medical Graphical Application

Abstract:
Major insufficiencies in healthcare systems today leave patients and clinicians alike wanting for a more effective way of receiving and giving care. Several major deficiencies are 1) the lack of an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR), lifelog, and personal omics data, and 2) the lack of standardization across healthcare systems, data standards, and terminologies. This incompatibility creates inefficiencies in operating personalized medicine, leading to problems with interoperability and introducing ambiguity into the healthcare environment, especially amongst patients, their providers, and organizations. Our work focuses on developing a data-integrated patient timeline dashboard. While many specialty-specific and administrative clinical dashboards may already exist, there is not much –if any– literature available that describes general clinical dashboards that are oriented around patient care, can be used across various medical specialties, and explain how computations on the dashboard are conducted. Our work aims to consolidate the overwhelming amount of data and graphics in a patient’s medical history into a single accessible platform. Key aspects of this dashboard include options for what performance indicators to see, variety in the data sources being used for visualization, and interactive capabilities for both patients and clinicians. To accomplish the creation of this dashboard, we worked in two sub-teams, with one focused on understanding the types of available data and standards to be followed, researching relevant UI/UX practices to be followed when working with medical data, and the other discovering potential software tools that can be used to store this data and create dashboards.
